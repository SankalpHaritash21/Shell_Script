## What is Shell Script

A shell script is a list of commands in a computer program that is run by the Unix shell, which is a command-line interpreter. A shell script usually has comments that describe the steps.

- Allows you to run if-else statements and loops.
- A file that contains a series of commands.
- A plain text file.
- Executes the command on each line, one line at a time.
- The terminal usually allows just one command at a time.
- Shell script allows you to combine and run multiple commands together.

## When do we need a Shell Script?

- When you need to enter multiple shell commands and will need to do it again in the future.
- If you know how a piece of work needs to be performed, you can put that knowledge in a shell script.
- Shell scripts eliminate repetitive tasks through automation.
- Using a good script can reduce the chance of error.
- A shell script can perform a task faster than a human can.
- When you have to do a task more than once, but it's something that you rarely do.

## Why use Shell?

- Speed of deployment.
- No worrying about low-level programming objects.
- Ease and speed of learning.
- Performance and efficiency.
- Anything you can do on the command line can be automated by writing a shell script.
- Can automate tedious or repetitive tasks.
- Allows you to hand off work to others.
- Acts as a form of documentation.
- Fairly quick and easy to write.

## Objectives

- To understand the basics of shell scripting.
- To automate routine AWS tasks using shell scripts.
- To learn and apply AWS CLI commands within scripts.
- To explore best practices for scripting in a cloud environment.

## Why Shell Scripting for AWS?

Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks, managing systems, and handling large-scale cloud infrastructure. With AWS being one of the leading cloud service providers, combining shell scripting with AWS services allows for efficient and effective cloud management.
